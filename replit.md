# Overview

This is a text-based role-playing game inspired by the Wings of Fire book series, where players control an animus dragon (a dragon with magical powers) attending Jade Mountain Academy. The core gameplay revolves around making choices that affect the character's soul integrity - using animus magic corrupts the dragon's soul, creating a compelling risk-reward mechanic. Players must balance using their powerful magical abilities with preserving their humanity and moral compass.

The application is built as a full-stack web game with a React frontend and Express backend, featuring character generation, scenario-based storytelling, and persistent game state management.

## Recent Changes
- **Character Customization System** (January 2025): Added comprehensive character creator allowing players to choose tribe, powers, attributes, and animus status, plus randomization options.
- **Local Storage Migration** (January 2025): Completely converted from PostgreSQL database to local browser storage. Game now runs without any database dependencies or Replit Core requirements.
- **Enhanced Romance & Family System** (January 2025): Added comprehensive romance mechanics, mating system, dragonet inheritance, and multi-generational family tracking.
- **Expanded Achievement System** (January 2025): Added 25+ achievements across categories including magic, relationships, survival, and family legacy.
- **Multiple Game Endings** (January 2025): Implemented 12+ different endings based on player choices, including victory, tragic, neutral, and legendary outcomes.
- **Enhanced Magic Variety** (January 2025): Expanded animus spell system with 6+ spell types including enchantment, combat, healing, weather control, curses, and summoning.
- **Hybrid Dragon Support** (January 2025): Enhanced hybrid dragon generation with mixed tribal abilities and inheritance mechanics.
- **Comprehensive Animus Filtering System** (January 2025): Fixed persistent issue where animus magic prompts appeared for non-animus dragons. Implemented thorough filtering across all AI generation systems.
- **Enhanced Storyline Progression** (January 2025): Fixed custom actions, tribal powers, and special abilities to actually advance the story rather than just showing static results. Powers now generate new scenarios based on their effects.
- **Contextual Tribal Powers** (January 2025): Made tribal powers more relevant to current situations and properly integrated with the storyline progression system.
- **Location-Based Migration System** (January 2025): Added comprehensive travel system with 15+ locations across Pyrrhia and Pantala continents, featuring location-specific scenarios, tribal relationships, migration animations, and Wings of Fire lore integration.
- **Special Events System** (January 2025): Implemented rare, time-gated special events including animus artifact discoveries, mindreading scenarios, and prophecy events. These complement existing gameplay with 5-minute cooldowns and dragon-type requirements.
- **Animus Artifact System** (January 2025): Added 5 unique collectible animus artifacts with complex moral choices, soul corruption mechanics, and location-based discovery system. Maximum 3 artifacts per playthrough.
- **Enhanced Outcome Display** (January 2025): Integrated continue button system that displays story outcomes before proceeding to next scenario, improving narrative flow and player engagement.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client is built with **React 18** using **TypeScript** and **Vite** as the build tool. The UI leverages **shadcn/ui** components built on **Radix UI** primitives, styled with **TailwindCSS** for a modern, accessible interface. State management is handled through **TanStack Query** for server state and React hooks for local state.

The routing system uses **Wouter** for lightweight client-side navigation. The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation between game logic (housed in utility classes) and presentation components.

## Backend Architecture  
The server runs on **Express.js** with TypeScript, following a simple REST API pattern. The architecture includes:

- **Route handlers** in `/server/routes.ts` for game state CRUD operations
- **Storage abstraction layer** with an in-memory implementation (`MemStorage`) for development
- **Middleware** for request logging and error handling
- **Schema validation** using Zod for type-safe data handling

The backend is designed to be database-agnostic through the `IStorage` interface, making it easy to swap storage implementations.

## Game Engine Design
The core game logic is centralized in a `GameEngine` class that processes player choices and updates game state. Key design decisions include:

- **Immutable state updates** - all game state changes return new objects
- **Scenario-based progression** - the game generates contextual scenarios based on character state and history
- **Soul corruption system** - the central mechanic where magic use gradually corrupts the character
- **Deterministic randomness** - random elements are controlled to ensure fair gameplay

## Data Storage Solutions
Now uses **local browser storage (localStorage)** for all game data persistence, eliminating database dependencies entirely. The storage system includes:

- **LocalGameStorage** class handling all data persistence in browser localStorage
- **Game states** stored as structured JSON including character data, relationships, dragonets, and life events
- **Save/Load system** with multiple game slot support and save game management
- **Import/Export functionality** allowing players to backup and share their game data
- **Type-safe schemas** maintained for data consistency using Zod validation

## Development Environment
The project is configured for **Replit** deployment with:
- **Hot module replacement** in development
- **ESBuild** for production bundling  
- **Integrated development tools** including error overlays and debugging support
- **Path aliases** for clean imports (`@/` for client, `@shared/` for shared code)

# External Dependencies

## Database Integration
- **Drizzle ORM** with PostgreSQL dialect for database operations
- **@neondatabase/serverless** for cloud database connectivity
- **connect-pg-simple** for session management (prepared for future authentication)

## UI and Styling
- **Radix UI** component library for accessible, unstyled primitives
- **TailwindCSS** for utility-first styling with custom design system
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography
- **class-variance-authority** for component variant management

## State Management and Data Fetching
- **TanStack React Query** for server state management, caching, and synchronization
- **React Hook Form** with **Hookform Resolvers** for form validation
- **Zod** for runtime type validation and schema generation

## Development and Build Tools
- **Vite** for fast development server and optimized production builds
- **TypeScript** for type safety across the entire application
- **ESBuild** for fast JavaScript bundling in production
- **Replit-specific plugins** for enhanced development experience on the platform

## Utility Libraries
- **date-fns** for date manipulation and formatting
- **clsx** and **tailwind-merge** for conditional CSS class handling
- **nanoid** for generating unique identifiers
- **cmdk** for command palette functionality
